PROJECT   REVIEW


1.What inspired you to develop this program?The apple watch inspired me to developed this program. I wanted to make something that was like the apple watch. Since it has a whole bunch of different options for you to use. My program used a temperature option, a date and time option, and a next holiday option.

2.A road block I had with writing my prgram was how to make a part of the program work.Like the temperature function in my program since I couldn't do it properly for a bit.I solved my problem by getting help with it and looking for a program that was like my function.

3.I would have liked to add an extra function. Like checking the battery function.Since it would allow us to know when we need to charge the watch.
